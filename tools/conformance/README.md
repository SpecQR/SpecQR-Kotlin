# Development-only conformance tools

Every candidate QR operation in these tools runs the actual Kotlin implementation
in a separate Java 17+ JVM. Python orchestrates comparisons; Node runs independent
references and decoders. Neither is involved in generating candidate symbols.
The production library depends only on the JDK and Kotlin standard library. No Java edition, encoder, or decoder is used by the candidate runtime.

From the repository root, with Java 17+ (`java` and adjacent `javac`), Kotlin
2.4.20, Python 3.11+ and Node 18+ installed:

```sh
export KOTLIN_HOME=/absolute/path/to/kotlinc
npm ci --prefix tools/conformance --ignore-scripts
git clone https://github.com/SpecQR/SpecQR.git ../SpecQR-baseline
git -C ../SpecQR-baseline checkout 15ad15e5c770ea0e39072f8f88b2733018f02ffd
python3 tools/conformance/verify_conformance.py --baseline ../SpecQR-baseline
python3 tools/conformance/verify_jsqr.py
python3 tools/conformance/verify_decoders.py --decoder cpp --dependency-dir .tools/zxing-cpp
python3 tools/conformance/verify_decoders.py --decoder java --dependency-dir .tools/zxing-java
```

The default candidate is this checkout. `--candidate PATH` selects another source
checkout. `--candidate-java /absolute/jdk/bin/java` selects the candidate JVM;
the bridge compiles only `src/main/kotlin` with `kotlinc`, language/API 2.2,
JVM target 17 and warnings as errors. It separately compiles the Java test adapter
with adjacent `javac --release 17`, then launches only those compiled candidate
classes, adapter classes, and `kotlin-stdlib.jar` in temporary storage.
`SPECQR_JAVA` sets the default JVM. ZXing Java's separate `--java` option selects
its decoder JVM and is independent of the candidate runtime.

For a built-artifact consumer check, add `--jar /absolute/path/specqr-kotlin.jar`
to each command. This compiles only the adapter against that exact JAR and uses
a classpath consisting solely of the adapter classes, the JAR, and Kotlin standard library. It does not
load the source checkout in place of the artifact. Building and inspecting the
JAR are separate checks; merely passing `--jar` is not a packaging audit.

Decoder wheels must support the selected Python/OS. `--no-install` uses only
already hash-verified decoder files and fails when they are missing. Nayuki/jsQR
can be resolved from a separate prepared package directory with
`SPECQR_DEV_NODE_MODULES=/absolute/package/directory`. Decoder libraries, binaries,
node_modules, generated reports, and fixtures are never production dependencies.
Use `--output PATH` to store reports outside the checkout when desired.

## Exact scope and controls

- Live pinned-JavaScript comparisons: 3,028 public matrices, including every
  version 1–40 × ECC L/M/Q/H × mask 0–7, Numeric, Alphanumeric, Byte, Kanji,
  mixed manual segments, automatic optimization, automatic masks, ECI boundaries,
  FNC1 first/second, GS1, ECC boost, deterministic Unicode fuzz, and 160 randomized
  binary cases. Comparisons include all padded data codewords, all interleaved
  data/ECC codewords, version, ECC, mask, and a SHA-256 of every matrix module.
- Independent Nayuki 1.8.0 comparisons: 2,400 matrices, including all 1,280
  version/ECC/mask combinations. Fixed versions and masks disable independent
  auto-mask/segmentation/ECC-boost differences. Segment boundaries are preserved.
- Internal comparisons: 4,320 raw matrices (three data patterns × 40 versions ×
  four ECC levels × automatic and eight explicit masks), all eight mask scores,
  all 65,536 GF products, and RS generator/remainder degrees 1–255.
- Public planning: 640 exact capacities and 1,920 at/below/above capacity
  estimates across all versions, ECCs, and data modes. Structured Append compares
  22 sets and 112 matrices, including exact member data/ECC codewords. Eight-thread shared-process replay compares another
  256 matrices. Malformed inputs require Kotlin `SpecQrException` and a recognized
  stable error code; ordinary JVM exceptions are not accepted as typed failures.
- Six candidate negative controls each launch a real JVM and reach the Kotlin API
  before corrupting a matrix hash, a data byte, or an interleaved codeword, or
  forcing an exit, missing response, or error. Three additional controls ensure
  untyped exception leaks are rejected. Candidate and decoder response counts
  are strict; truncation never becomes a pass.

The reports record source fingerprints, candidate JVM/version/PID/nonce, Kotlin metadata and standard-library fingerprint,
class-loading origin, classpath, compiled class or JAR fingerprints, reference
commit/source fingerprints, reference corpus hashes, and test-tool fingerprints.
Changed sources, binaries or test tools invalidate the conformance result.
`--suite public` or `--suite internal` is explicitly a scoped result.

## Three independent decoders

- jsQR 1.4.0: 232 matrix and 232 real-PNG detections, all versions, Numeric,
  Alphanumeric, Byte, Kanji, binary bytes, and 64 ECI-header checks. FNC1 and
  Structured Append are unsupported by jsQR and are only claimed in ZXing lanes.
- ZXing-C++ 3.1.1: 706 matrix and 750 real-PNG detections, all versions,
  135 legal Structured Append headers, all 152 FNC1-second indicators via manual
  and high-level APIs (304 symbols), ECI bytes/text/metadata, five complete
  high-level sets (44 symbols), and independent set reconstruction.
- ZXing Java 3.5.4: 446 matrix and 446 real-PNG detections, all versions,
  135 Structured Append headers and sequence/parity metadata, five complete
  high-level sets reconstructed through both routes, and 32 damaged-symbol tests
  that each require three independently corrected codewords.

Every real PNG pixel and quiet-zone pixel is verified before detection. Java
strict PNG detection uses scale 3 without `PURE_BARCODE`, with no matrix fallback
when detection fails. The known default-scale-8 PNG detector behavior is retained
as a separate diagnostic alongside an independent identical-pixel PNG; failures
remain explicit and never increment strict success counts. C++ tests default
scale 8. Every decoder must reject an actual all-white negative control.

These finite synthetic tests are not ISO/GS1 certification, camera/print testing,
or a guarantee for arbitrary inputs or damage. No failed decode, absent version,
missing dependency, changed source, or omitted test is silently counted as a pass.

## Provenance and pinned development dependencies

Adapted for Kotlin from MIT-licensed SpecQR-Java
`1f2bf277a582f0eb4e31c9975443c1a76552aa23`, itself adapted from SpecQR-Python tools at
`1deb5cf83ed7a93eeb44138e5980a963a00cdffb`. The upstream oracle, Structured Append
corpus, ECI control and decoder workflow derive from SpecQR-CPP
`e91cd8fe4434fd6ef10d1126bb2fd17b0b19321f`; the Java decoder and pinned decoder
requirements derive from SpecQR-CSharp
`057c4b3f25e52c4786a8f94c744ff884eedcecfa`. The Java decoder preserves the original
SpecQR-Swift attribution. JavaScript baseline:
`15ad15e5c770ea0e39072f8f88b2733018f02ffd`.

The npm lock contains package integrity hashes. ZXing Java JAR SHA-256 and
ZXing-C++ official PyPI wheel hashes are checked by the tools. No third-party
encoder or decoder source, binary, dependency or import enters the Kotlin runtime.
